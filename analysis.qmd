#### Variables and Relationships of Interest

This analysis aims to investigate the relationship between mean post-graduation earnings, a post-college academic indicator of success, with student characteristics of race and socioeconomic status. By identifying if there exists a correlation between specific student characteristics and pre-college factors with post-college success outcomes, the analysis aims to provide insight on whether financial success is related to race and socioeconomic status.

```

The **Welch Two Sample t-test** results indicate a statistically significant difference in post-graduation earnings between HBCU and non-HBCU graduates *(p-value = 5.09e-08)*. The mean earnings for HBCU graduates *($30,646.67)* are significantly lower than those of non-HBCU graduates *($46,492.66)*. The 95% confidence interval for the difference in means ranges from -18,530.66 to -13,161.34, confirming that HBCU graduates earn considerably less, on average, than their non-HBCU counterparts. This result supports the idea that there exist a significant earnings gap between HBCUs and non-HBCUs.

```
1. **Asian Students:** There is a positive correlation between the number of Asian students and average earnings, indicating that colleges with more Asian students tend to have higher average post-graduation earnings.
2. **Black Students:** There is a negative correlation between the number of Black students and average earnings, indicating that colleges with more Black students tend to have lower average post-graduation earnings.
3. **White Students:** There is a positive correlation between the number of White students and average earnings, indicating that colleges with more White students tend to have higher average post-graduation earnings.
4. **Hispanic Students:** There is a positive correlation between number of Hispanic students and average earnings, but the best-fit line is less steep than for their Asian and White counterparts. 

These plots highlight the disparity in post-graduation earnings across racial groups, with Asian and White students exhibiting higher earnings, on average, than Black and Hispanic students. Further statistical experimentation and tests would be necessary to draw claims about causality.

## Linear Model for Racial Disparity in Post-Graduation Earnings

education_cohort_data_cleaned <- read_rds("dataset/education_cohort_data_cleaned.rds")

    Num_Asian_Students = Pop * Perc_Undergrad_Asian,
    Social_Econ_Div = 1-Socioeconomic_Div
  )

```
#### Model Overview: 
Every race variable from the `education_cohort_data_cleaned` dataset is included to build a simple linear regression. It displays the change in median earnings as a function of racial composition change, with no other factors included.

#### Model Findings: 
**Num_White_Students:** A one White student increase in a school is associated with a $0.168 increase in the expected value of mean post-grad earnings of students, but it is not significant *(p = 0.947)*.

**Num_Black_Students:** A one Black student increase in a school is associated with a $0.948 decrease in the expected value of mean post-grad earnings of students, and it is significant *(p = 0.007)*.

**Num_Asian_Students:** A one Asian student increase in a school is associated with a $2.282 increase in the expected value of mean post-grad earnings of students, and it is highly significant *(p < 0.001)*.

**Num_Hispanic_Students:** A one Hispanic student increase in a school is associated with a $0.394 decrease in the expected value of mean post-grad earnings of students, and it is significant *(p = 0.0147)*.

The adjusted R-square value of **0.1328** shows that approximately 13.28% of the variation in median earnings within schools is explained by the model, indicating the model has only a small portion of explanatory power.

The findings from this regression model show disparity in mean earnings after graduating based on the racial composition of undergraduate students. Specifically, schools with higher percentages of Black students are associated with lower earnings. On the other hand, a higher proportion of Asian students is strongly correlated to higher earnings. However, the low number of adjusted R-square is a sign of omitted variable bias. The model could be improved by adding some control variables. including economic and institutional factors. 

## Residual Plots for The Initial Model
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
education_cohort_data_cleaned <- education_cohort_data_cleaned |>
  mutate(
    Residuals = resid(model_race),
    Fitted_Values = fitted(model_race)
  )

# residual for Black
plot_black <- ggplot(education_cohort_data_cleaned, aes(x = Perc_Undergrad_Black, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Residuals vs Black",
    x = "Percentage of Black Students",
    y = "Residuals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

#For Asian
plot_asian <-ggplot(education_cohort_data_cleaned, aes(x = Perc_Undergrad_Asian, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Residuals vs Asian",
    x = "Percentage of Asian Students",
    y = "Residuals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# residual for White
plot_white <-ggplot(education_cohort_data_cleaned, aes(x = Perc_Undergrad_White, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Residuals vs White",
    x = "Percentage of White Students",
    y = "Residuals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# residual for Hispanic
plot_hispanic <-ggplot(education_cohort_data_cleaned, aes(x = Perc_Undergrad_Hispanic, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Residuals vs Hispanic",
    x = "Percentage of Hispanic Students",
    y = "Residuals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

combined_plot <- plot_asian + plot_black + plot_hispanic + plot_white + 
                 plot_layout(ncol = 2, nrow = 2)

combined_plot
```
- **Asian students:** The residuals show a tighter cluster around zero at lower percentages of Asian students, but as percentage increases, exhibits increasing variability.
- **Black students:** The residuals are concentrated more closer near zero at lower percentages of Black students, but spread out at higher percentages.
- **Hispanic students:** The residuals are mostly centered around zero at lower percentages of Hispanic students, but show greater variability as the proportion increases.
- **White students:** The residuals display less variability and appear more evenly distributed across the range of percentages compared to other groups.

These residual plots indicate heteroskedasticity, where the variance of residuals is not constant across the predictor variable. 

## Linear Model of Racial Disparities in Post-Graduation Earnings After Adding a Socioeconomic Factor
#### Model Overview:
Adding variables that correspond to student's socioeconomic factors may serve reduce the omitted variable bias and therefore, improve the model fit. In this model, the `Socioeconomic_Div` variable is added. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_race <- lm(
  Avg_Mean_earning ~ Num_White_Students + 
    Num_Black_Students + 
    Num_Hispanic_Students + 
    Num_Asian_Students +
    Social_Econ_Div,
  data = education_cohort_data_cleaned
)
summary_model <- summary(model_race)

# Print coefficients and statistics
cat("Coefficients, Standard Errors and p-values:\n")
print(summary_model$coefficients[, c("Estimate", "Std. Error", "Pr(>|t|)")])
cat("\nR-squared:\n")
cat("Multiple R-squared:", summary_model$r.squared, "\n")
cat("Adjusted R-squared:", summary_model$adj.r.squared, "\n")
cat("\nF-statistic and p-value:\n")
cat("F-statistic:", summary_model$fstatistic[1], "on", summary_model$fstatistic[2], "and", summary_model$fstatistic[3], "DF, p-value:", 
    pf(summary_model$fstatistic[1], summary_model$fstatistic[2], summary_model$fstatistic[3], lower.tail = FALSE), "\n")
```
#### Model Findings
The small p-value for Social_Econ_Div *(1.04e-46)* indicates that it is highly statistically significant, suggesting a very strong relationship between socioeconomic diversity and average mean earnings. Its inclusion substantially increases the Multiple R-squared value, from approximately 0.14 to 0.42. This indicates that the model’s ability to explain the variability in average earnings has improved significantly. The increase in R-squared confirms that `Social_Econ_Div` helps the model explain the data more accurately.

However, adding `Social_Econ_Div` to the linear regression model significantly changes the results because it is a highly influential variable in the dependent variable `Avg_Mean_earning`, according to the increasing R-squared. When `Social_Econ_Div`, which calculates the percent low income students under the Federal Pell Grant, is introduced, it strongly correlates with average post-grad earnings. This new predictor changes the “explanatory responsibility” of the other variables in the model, causing their coefficients to shift significantly.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the dataset
education_data <- read_rds("dataset/education_cohort_data_cleaned.rds")

# Plot the data with a best-fit line
education_data |>
  mutate(Social_Econ_Div = 1 - Socioeconomic_Div) |>
  select(Social_Econ_Div, Socioeconomic_Div, Avg_Mean_earning) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Social_Econ_Div, y = Avg_Mean_earning)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +  # Scatter plot with transparency
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", se = TRUE) +  # Best-fit line with confidence interval
  labs(
    title = "Socioeconomic Diversity vs. Average Mean Earnings",
    x = "Socioeconomic Diversity",
    y = "Average Mean Earnings"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Limitations
There is the potential issue of multicollinearity, as evidenced by the significant coefficient shifts after adding the socioeconomic diversity variable `Social_Econ_Div`. In other words, predictors such as racial composition were "capturing" part of the socioeconomic effect, making it difficult to disentangle their individual contributions. Multicollinearity reduces the reliability of the coefficients, which can lead to unstable interpretations regarding the precise effect of each variable.

Another limitation is the simplicity of the model in its current form. While adding `Social_Econ_Div` improved the explanatory power (R-squared increased significantly), there are likely additional omitted variables—such as school funding, geographic location, or program types—that could further explain post-graduation earnings disparities. Additionally, this model assumes a linear relationship between predictors and earnings, which might oversimplify more complex, non-linear patterns that exist in the data.

Lastly, this dataset categorizes race in its simplest form: White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic. More nuanced data-such as incorporating ethnicity and smaller racial groups-is necessary in drawing key conclusions about the complex racial dynamics in higher education.
