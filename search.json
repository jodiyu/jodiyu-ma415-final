It compiles data on metrics such as net price, graduation rates, student diversity, median graduate debt, salary data, and student loan repayment information.\nThe goal of this dataset was to create a federal tool that offers comprehensive institutional profiles, synthesizing complex and multi-dimensional aspects of higher education into understandable and standardized metrics.\nArticle found here."

    "section": "Initial Analysis on Flaws and Limitations",
    "text": "Initial Analysis on Flaws and Limitations\nAlthough serving as a centralized federal postsecondary information system, the College Scorecard contains flaws that undermine its overall effectiveness:\n\nLack of Qualitative Information: The Scorecard focuses primarily on quantitative variables, particularly monetary measures of value. By reducing the measure of an institution’s worth to numerical factors, the Scorecard does not fully encapsulate an institution’s mission or character. This emphasis on financial metrics strips away the nuances of an institution and can lead to an inaccurate portrayal of the college experience.\nInstitutions Covered: Postsecondary institutions sometimes comprise of separate campuses, including online programs and programs under different names. Each organization chooses which of its separate campuses to report data separately, which may cause complications in accurately comparing institutions with branch locations.\nCohort Definitions Vary for Different Metrics: Measures of institutional performance are sometimesbased on different groups of students and are organized by different event dates. Users should exercise linking different data metrics with caution.\nEarnings Data is Limited: Earnings data are estimated for undergraduate Title IV recipients, due to its origination from the NSLDS earnings records. The share of each institution’s student body of Title IV students varies substantially due to state and institutional aid policies. In institutions where this share is low, results may be less representative of the entire student body."

The cleaned dataset is 527 rows x 47 columns.\nThe College Scorecard Data Dictionary was used to parse through abbreviated terminology and retain all relevant data values.

Data entries with the value “PS”, for privacy suppressed data, were removed for consistency. - All med_loan_# variables, initially in char format, were changed into numeric values. - The Avg_Mean_earning variable was created and added as a separate column, calculated by averaging all average mean earnings from Years 6-10 for each corresponding row.\nTechnical documentation on the data can be found here.\n\n# Condensed description of data cleaning process\n\n# Loaded in the data\neducation_cohort_data &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"dataset-ignore\",\"Most-Recent-Cohorts-Institution.csv\"))\n\n# Documented relevant data columns\ntable_cols &lt;- c(\n  # Institution and demographics on student population\n  \"INSTNM\", \"STABBR\", ...\n  \n  # Repeated this process for all relevant categories\n  \n# Change data names\neducation_cohort_data &lt;- education_cohort_data |&gt;\n  rename(\n    Institution = INSTNM,\n    State = STABBR, ...\n    \n    # Repeated this process for all relevant categories\n    \n# Removed rows that listed NA for key numerical values\neducation_cohort_data &lt;- education_cohort_data |&gt;\n  filter_at(vars(one_of(cols_check_for_na)), all_vars(!is.na(.))) |&gt;\n  filter(if_all(all_of(Mean_earnings), ~ . != \"PS\"))\n\n# Calculated the mean earning average for each university\neducation_cohort_data &lt;- education_cohort_data |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(Avg_Mean_earning = mean(c_across(starts_with(\"Mean_earnings_After_\")), na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()"

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."
