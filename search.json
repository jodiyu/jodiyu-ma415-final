    "section": "Initial Analysis on Flaws and Limitations",
    "text": "Initial Analysis on Flaws and Limitations\nAlthough serving as a centralized federal postsecondary information system, the College Scorecard contains flaws that undermine its overall effectiveness:\n\nLack of Qualitative Information: The Scorecard focuses primarily on quantitative variables, particularly monetary measures of value. By reducing the measure of an institution’s worth to numerical factors, the Scorecard does not fully encapsulate an institution’s mission or character. This emphasis on financial metrics strips away the nuances of an institution and can lead to an inaccurate portrayal of the college experience.\nInstitutions Covered: Postsecondary institutions sometimes comprise of separate campuses, including online programs and programs under different names. Each organization chooses which of its separate campuses to report data separately, which may cause complications in accurately comparing institutions with branch locations.\nCohort Definitions Vary for Different Metrics: Measures of institutional performance are sometimesbased on different groups of students and are organized by different event dates. Users should exercise linking different data metrics with caution.\nEarnings Data is Limited: Earnings data are estimated for undergraduate Title IV recipients, due to its origination from the NSLDS earnings records. The share of each institution’s student body of Title IV students varies substantially due to state and institutional aid policies. In institutions where this share is low, results may be less representative of the entire student body."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Introduction\nTHE AMERICAN DREAM: the shiny ideal that America is the land of opportunity and social mobility, and every person, regardless of their race, gender, and socioeconomic status, has the opportunity to climb the social ladder and succeed with enough hard work and determination. Perpetuating the idea of a colorblind society, perhaps any skew in data - certain racial groups having higher incarceration rates or higher poverty levels - can simply be attributed to just that: they didn’t work hard enough. They were given an opportunity for social mobility and failed to seize it. We must ask ourselves: Can anyone who works hard become successful? Does the American Dream even exist, or was it never real to begin with?\n\nWhy is Analyzing Higher Education Data Important?\nAnalyzing higher education data provides valuable insight into a population of students who have opted to pursue higher education, identifying patterns that inform if there exists a fundamental difference in later income and social mobility and status based upon characteristics such as their race and socioeconomic status. This data can further inform if there perhaps lie varying degrees of difficulty to succeed financially for certain groups over other groups, leading back to the question: Does the American Dream in higher education exist?\nNote: “Difficulty” itself is a subjective term, as is determining “working hard” as a quantitative measure. The following analysis does not serve to quantitatively define these terms, but does observe that students pursuing a higher degree have put in a baseline level of hard work to which questions arise over if this serves as a predictor to future income/socioeconomic status level."

    "text": "Thesis Statement\nThe Earnings Gap: Analyzing Racial Disparity in Post-Graduation Wages Across U.S. Colleges\nPost-Graduation earnings across the U.S. colleges are correlated to student demographic factors, specifically socioeconomic status and race. In particular, students from lower income brackets have lower post-graduation earnings than students from high income brackets (1). Further, Black and Hispanic students have lower post-graduation earnings than their White and Asian counterparts (2).\n\nI. Socioeconomically Diverse Institutions Have Lower Median Earnings\n\nPost Grad Earnings based on the Percent of Students with Pell Grants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent Pell Grant and Socioeconomic diversity: Defined in the data set as the share of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students who received Pell Grants in a given year. Pell Grants are awarded only to undergraduate students who display financial need, and unlike a loan, it does not have to be repaid. This serves as an important measure of the access an institution provides to low-income students, thereby an indicator of an institution’s socioeconomic diversity. Read more about Pell Grants here.\nThe bar graph conveys the following idea: Institutions who support more lower-income students, albeit more socioeconomically diverse student bodies, have lower post-graduation earnings. This provides evidence that student affluence level prior to college serves as predictor for post-grad earnings.\n\n\n\nII. Institutions with Majority-Minority Student Populations Have Lower Post-Grad Earnings\n\nAverage Student Post-Grad Earnings Across U.S. Institutions by Dominant Race Population\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Earnings After College: Defined in the dataset as the mean earnings for students at each institution, each year starting 6 years after a student enrolls in college, up to 10 years after the student enrolls. Enrollment dates are estimated based on FAFSA self-reporting. This data analysis takes the mean of all mean earnings from 6 to 10 years to provide a centralized value for student earnings from 6-10 years after enrollment at each institution.\nThe plot supports the following idea: There is a difference in post-grad earnings for schools based on their dominant race student population\n\nAsian: The median post-grad earnings for institutions where Asians are the dominant population appear to be around 60,000. The interquartile range (IQR) spans from approximately 50,000 to 70,000, with a few outliers extending up to 100,000 and below 40,000.\nBlack: Institutions with a dominant Black population show the lowest median earnings, around 40,000. The IQR is quite narrow, suggesting less variability in earnings, with outliers extending slightly above 60,000 and below 20,000.\nHispanic: Median earnings for Hispanic-dominant institutions are around 50,000. The IQR is moderate, spanning from about 40,000 to 60,000, with fewer extreme outliers compared to other groups.\nWhite Institutions with a dominant White population have a median earnings level similar to Asian-dominant institutions, around 60,000. The IQR is wider, indicating more variability in earnings, with several outliers extending above 100,000.\n\nThe data suggests that there are significant disparities in post-graduate earnings based on the dominant race population of institutions. Institutions with dominant Asian or White populations tend to have higher median earnings compared to those with dominant Black or Hispanic populations."

The dataset aggregates post-grad student earnings for each college, without specifying individual race metrics. Multiplying the proportion student population of a specified race by the student population, and then multiplying the product by the amount post-grad earnings provides a numeric measurement to how racial groups from different colleges are broadly doing post graduation. It is by no means a representation for how individual students are earning, but provides valuable insight in recognizing patterns and understanding racial dynamics on a high level.\nData was analyzed on the state level:\nAverage Earnings for Each Race in Each State = Sum of Weighted Earnings for Each Race / Sum of Population\n\nKey Insights\n\nWhite and Asian students who graduate tend to earn more on average in comparison to Black and Hispanic students who graduate,\nGeographically speaking, states in the Northeast and West Coast generally have higher earnings, while the South and parts of the Midwest consistently show lower earnings across all races."

    "text": "Conclusion: Unveiling Disparity in Higher Education Metrics\nThe data depicted in the graphs and map reveal a clear pattern: the mean earnings post-graduation vary significantly by both racial demographics and socioeconomic status. And although it cannot be conclusively drawn that the American Dream imposes a false idealistic reality that hard work can automatically be translated to success for any American irregardless of race and socioeconomic status, it is important to note this discrepancy: certain racial groups and people of lower income brackets have lower mean earnings after enrollment in higher education. Simply “buying into” the American Dream can be a comforting notion, but it can also perpetuate harmful stereotypes that people of lower socioeconomic status deserve it because they simply didn’t work as hard. As we move forward, understanding the interplay between race, affluence, and post-graduation earnings can serve as important tool to tackling racial and socioeconomic divide."
